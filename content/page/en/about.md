ACM SIGIR<sup>*</sup> is the largest international research community in the field of information retrieval (IR) and organizes peer-reviewed international conferences such as SIGIR, WSDM, CIKM, CHIIR, and so on. ACM has approved “Tokyo ACM SIGIR Chapter” as the first SIGIR local chapter in Japan since 27th December, 2017.

In Japan, IR is one of computer science fields where researchers have been energetically working from diverse perspectives such as information access, databases, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, digital libraries, knowledge management, and so on.

Tokyo ACM SIGIR Chapter distributes SIGIR updates to IR researchers in Japan working on various IR research topics. In addition, our chapter aims at encouraging interactions between domestic and international IR research communities by holding some events related to SIGIR sponsored conferences. We hope that these activities make the presence of Japan in the international IR research community much better.

Last but not least, we are recruiting members who agree with our aim and support our activities. We would appreciate it very much if you would join our chapter.

Thank you very much for your support for Tokyo ACM SIGIR Chapter!
